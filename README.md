# CYCLORAMA

 **_A movie app made for the Charter/Spectrum Front-End Code Challenge_**

[Deployed Page](https://cyclorama-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Challenge Specifications

### User stories are as follows:

• A user should be able to view a home page with a list of movies with their image and title.

• A user should be able to filter movies by genre. This filter should default to “All” and take immediate effect
when a selection is made. No additional clicks should be necessary when filtering.

• A user should be able to search for a movie by title.

• A user should be able to click into a movie to view additional detail.

• The genre filter and search should work together. 
The genre filter should not reset the search and the search
should not reset the genre filter. When both are used, only results that fit both criteria should be shown, not
either one or the other.

• A user should be able to reset the search by clearing the text value in the search input.

• If any of the filters do not return any movies, the UI should indicate that no results were found.

• If the image for a specific movie is not found, the application should display the included “defaultImage”

### What we are looking for:

• Deployed application

• Modern styling with well-organized CSS

• Using TypeScript is highly encouraged

• No use of third-party component libraries such as Bootstrap or Material-UI

• Using Create-React-App, Next.js, or Gatsby as a starter kit is okay

• Well organized file structure

• Descriptive naming conventions

• DRY code that is readable and production ready

• Reusable components

• Sound logic for how the search and filter are architected

• Full Git history with atomic commits

### Stretch goals:

• Unit tests

• Pagination of movies on home screen

• CI / CD

• Feel free to get creative with additional features!
